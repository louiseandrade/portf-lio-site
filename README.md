My first project in Udacity

On my first from Udacity, I received a mockup of PDF design and developed a responsive website that displayed the images, descriptions and links agreed upon.

In order to finish my project, I received style guidelines (CSS and HTML) so that my project was perfectly optimized, accessible, and also personalized!
